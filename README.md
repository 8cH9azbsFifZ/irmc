# What is IRMC?
IRMC stands for Internet Relay Morse Code. It implements the CWCom protocol

## Why morse code over IP?
Why not? A number of different approaches for CW over IP exist. An early implementation has been the CWCom protocol, 
which has been the basis for Morse KOB, a ready-to-use software. Both chat programs have been written for CW exclusively and are compatible. An alternative implementation in C exists as well as a port to the ATMEL AVR Microcontroller. 


# How to build?
## Install dependency: morse keyer library
```
wget https://github.com/8cH9azbsFifZ/morse/archive/v0.1.tar.gz
tar xzf v0.1.tar.gz
cd morse-0.1
libtoolize
./autogen.sh
./configure  --with-portaudio
make
sudo make install
```

## Debian (Wheezy)
Some dependencies have to be installed:
```
apt-get install -y alsa-oss oss-compat build-essential autoconf libao-dev libtool
```
Afterwards compilation with `make` should work. If something went wrong, you may have
to adjust your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Alternatively try:
```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib ./irmc mtc-kob.dyndns.org 7890 33 123 
```

## OSX (Yosemite)

### Serial Drivers
TBD: Driver: serial - 2usb!


# How to use:

The usage is: `irmc [hostname] [port] [channel] [id] [serialport`

For example:
`./irmc mtc-kob.dyndns.org 7890 103 MyID /dev/tty.usbserialÂ´

> I have been using cwcom to practice sending morsecode, unfortunately my main computer at home is running openbsd and it has gotten harder to gain access to a reliable MS Windows machine. So I wrote my own client that works on openbsd. 
> This is written in C and although not tested it should compile under other OS. If any one wants to try it and send me feedback. you can download version 0.01 here http://fernan.bitbucket.org/irmc.tgz
> Les Kerr of https://home.comcast.net/~morsekob/ has been very patient in answering my questions regarding the cwcom protocol and setting up a test server during debugging.
